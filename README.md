# TwitterBotPoster
A twitter bot written in Python based on Tweepy

Hello there! 

So this program has been running on my PC powering the TwitterBot @AiCuddles

Cuddles is designed to become happy when a new person starts following and very upset when a person leaves. 

Cuddles posts once per hour and randomly selects royalty free images and text based on how it's feeling. 

How it's feeling is based on an external file which it imports when it's time to post. 

This project was a lot of fun and I wanted to create one for instagram.
